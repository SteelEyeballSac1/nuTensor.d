## nuTensor.d

Definitely for advanced users.

This is a fork of the discontinued [nuTensor](https://github.com/geekprojects/nuTensor) which is a fork of the also discontinued [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).
Help is welcome (maybe this fork can stay alive a few months longer than the last fork).

Forked from [geekprojects/nuTensor](https://github.com/geekprojects/nuTensor). Merged from [Minimalist73/nuTensor](https://github.com/Minimalist73/nuTensor)

## Warnings

#### Regarding broken sites

I do not guarantee that all sites will function out of the box. It is up to the user to fix sites broken by nuTensor.d filters. Only open an issue if you belive nuTensor.d itself to be causing issues and not its settings.

**So this means do not file issues to report broken sites when the sites are broken because nuTensor.d does its job as expected.** I will close any such issue without further comment.

**Using nuTensor.d logger is key to un-break sites:** the logger will show you all that nuTensor.d does internally.
